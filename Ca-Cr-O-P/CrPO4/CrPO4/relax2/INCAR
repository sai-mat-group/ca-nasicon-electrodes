#GGA (PBE) calculation for CoO2 (3d transition metal oxide)
#Listed below are suitable modifications of INCAR required for doing other functional calculations
#
#Algorithms and convergence criteria (usually requires minor tweaks)
ALGO = Normal #Algorithm for doing "electronic" steps (inner loop)  
EDIFF = 1E-5 #Convergence criterion for energy, relevant for inner loop (in eV)
EDIFFG = -0.03 #Convergence criterion for outer loop (i.e., "ionic" steps). Negative sign indicates max force between atoms in eV/A.
ENCUT = 520 #Max energy of plane-waves used in basis set (in eV)
IBRION = 2 #Algorithm for moving ions after each inner loop
ICHARG = 1 #Initial guess for electron density
ISIF = 3 #What parameters in the cell should I "relax"? Just the ions or the volume and shape as well?
ISYM = 0 #Should VASP preserve symmetry during relaxation?
ISPIN = 2 #Spin-polarized calculation?
LREAL = Auto #Should "projection" operators be calculated in real-space?
NELMIN = 6 #Minimum number of electronic steps per inner loop
NELM = 150 #Maximum number of electronic steps per inner loop
NSW = 199 #Maximum number of steps for the outer loop
PREC = Accurate #Maintain a high level of precision in wave-functions used while going to reciprocal space
ISMEAR = 0 #Smearing --useful in getting convergence in metals
SIGMA = 0.05 #Extent of smearing (in eV).

#For CoO2: system specifications (**changes with system**)
MAGMOM = 6*3 6*0.06 24*0.06
#Assuming Co4+ is in a low-spin ferromagnetic configuration. Usually Co3+ (in LiCoO2) is in a low-spin (d6) non-magnetic configuration
#If you have a non-magnetic ion (e.g., Li+/O2-), always give the initial MAGMOM as a non-zero value here, helps in convergence.

#I-O (usually not changed)
LWAVE = False #Should wave-functions be explicitly written in an output file?
LORBIT = 11 #How should orbital projections of wave-functions be output? Useful since this also outputs magnetic moments on each atom.

#For computational performance (usually changed only when moving calculations to a new machine)
LPLANE = True  #How is parallel computing done across FFTs
NCORE = 16 #Parallelization across bands
NSIM = 4 #Speed up convergence by optimizing matrix-matrix operations

#Functional-based keywords
#For changing XC functional, adding U corrections, etc.
#
#For SCAN/SCAN+U calculations, the following 2 keywords are important
METAGGA = SCAN
LASPH = True

#For any calculation with a +U correction, the following keywords are needed (please remove them if not doing a +U calculation)
LDAU = TRUE # TURNS ON Dft +u CALCULATION
LDAUTYPE = 2 # What type of DFT +U theory used
LDAUU = 0 0 0  # SPecifies parameter value for each species in POSCAR file
LDAUJ = 0 0 0     # J parameter of DFT +U Claculation , by default its ZERO for all elements
LDAUL = 2 -1 -1 # Which orbital we are applying U correction
LDAUPRINT = 1 # Defines Printing
LMAXMIX = 4 # Its a way to help DFT converging calculation, Mixing paramters

# GGA :No command, SCAN : meta GGA without 7 commnads line, SCAN +U =meta GG+7 KEYWORDS, gga+u = NO META GGA + 7 KEY WORDS,U for Mn is 3.9 in GGA+U while U = 2.7 in SCAN +U
